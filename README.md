# Sprint 1_Restaurant_Sorted_Project

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This project builds upon the previous `Restaurant` class by implementing the necessary features to sort `Restaurant` objects by name and by rating in descending order. 

The `Restaurant` class contains two attributes: `name` (String) and `score` (int). The goal is to ensure that the restaurants can be stored in a collection that maintains this sorting order.

For example:
- `name: restaurant1, score: 8`
- `name: restaurant1, score: 7`

This implementation allows for easy retrieval and display of restaurants sorted first by name and then by rating.
